PURPOSE
This project is designed to take Zendesk Organizations and create them as GetHarvest Clients and 
take Zendesk Tickets and create them as GetHarvest Projects.  And then when tickets are closed in Zendesk
the Project in GetHarvest gets archived.

SETUP
Download all the files and upload them to a server that can support PHP and is externally accessible via
IP address or FQDN.  Amazon EC2 micro instances work well.
